# FAKE NEWS DETECTOR
Anna Nguyen, Aiesha Ayub, Aidan Murphy, Jialene Westcott

## Dataset: 
The data is downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/fake-news-detection/data and compressed as `fake-news-detection.zip`, containing 2 files: <br /> 
`true.csv`: real news data<br /> 
`fake.csv`: fake news data

## Project goal
The project aims to answer the following questions: 
1. Where do people mostly receive wrong information? 
2. What are the possible signs/words that fake news has?


## Methods
Models used in the training and testing process: <br/>
* Transformers
* Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Naive Bayes

## Results
The most potential model for our detector is Transformers with a training accuracy of 99.577%, followed by MLP with 99.22%, SVM with 98.57% and Naive Bayes with 94.35%. Even with a high accuracy, Transformers required a big amount of time to train the data. Itâ€™s also consuming more training time for MLP than SVM and Naive Bayes. Although SVM was only working on identifying the word patterns, it did a great job producing a high accuracy in a short amount of time, making it the most potential model among the other ones.
